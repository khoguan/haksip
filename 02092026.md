# 2026-02-09 學習日誌：數學、電腦

昨昏去買幾支仔筆，閣一本方格紙，60 張 52 箍，無俗，毋過足好寫！紙質比 70 gsm 个
影印紙較iu，行筆滑順；閣有豆腐格，毋但方便作圖，閣有引𤆬書寫个效果。

## 圓周角是伊个對應弧角度个一半

欲證明這，對圓心做三條半徑到圓周角个三點，利用等腰三角形底角相等就推理會出來。
因為作圖出來生做無仝，所以分做三種情形來證明：

1. 圓周角頂點佮伊个弦佇圓心个仝一爿。（即个圓周角是鈍角）
2. 圓周角个弦通過圓心，即條弦也就是直徑。（即个圓周角是直角）
3. 圓周角頂點佮伊个弦佇圓心个無仝爿。（即个圓周角是銳角）

以即个定理做觀點，**「以直徑做弦个圓周角角度恆為直角」**即个定理只是其中一種特例。

公家一弦，而且踮佇弦無仝爿个兩个圓周角之和，等於一个平角（180度）。

## 考慮將學習日誌repo公開

本學習日誌規个目錄有上傳去我个 Github repo，自底就設做 private，今考慮欲公開，
叫 Warp AI 共我查，無發現啥嚴重个資安風險，總是日誌內有出現一寡檔案系統个路徑名，
有包含我个 username 在內，這也是資安顧慮。

I did a repo-wide scan (tracked + untracked working tree) for common secret file
types, high-confidence credential patterns, and some PII indicators.

What looks OK (good news)

•  No .env, private key/cert bundles (*.pem, *.key, *.p12, etc.), password DBs,
or archives were found in the repo (common “oops” files).
•  No matches for high-confidence secret patterns in the working tree (e.g.
ghp_…, github_pat_…, AWS AKIA…, -----BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY-----, etc.).
•  I also probed git history for a few common token patterns
(AWS/GitHub/OpenAI/private-key headers) and didn’t find hits.

Things you should review before making it public
1) This repo is mostly personal journal/notes (potentially “embarrassing” by
nature)
There are many dated .md files that read like a personal learning diary (sleep,
habits, what you did that day, etc.). That’s not “secret”, but it is exactly the
kind of content people later regret publishing.

If you want a public version, consider:
•  publishing only curated notes (copy to a new repo), or
•  moving private journals into a separate private repo.

2) Your username + absolute home paths are present in multiple tracked files
Example categories of content I saw:
•  absolute paths like ~/... in notes under extras/ and several
dated logs
•  a tracked .nvimrc that literally says it’s for ~/Hak

This isn’t a credential leak, but it does reveal your local username and
filesystem layout.

Files to spot-check (not exhaustive, but representative from what matched):
•  .nvimrc
•  extras/markdown-formatter-solution.md
•  extras/08092025-nofolding.md
•  various dated logs like 07162025.md, 08122025.md, 08062025.md

3) Tracked images / PDFs: no GPS found, but metadata still exists
Tracked media includes:
•  too/IMG_2837.jpg (has EXIF; “software: Google” shows up)
•  multiple screenshots under too/…png (one includes an embedded color profile:
DELL P2715Q)
•  PDFs under test/…pdf (created by Typst 0.13.1, with creation timestamps)

Spotlight metadata did not show GPS lat/long for these files. That said:
•  screenshots can visually include usernames, file paths, open tabs,
notifications, etc.
•  JPG EXIF can sometimes include timestamps/device info even without GPS

4) Your current working tree has untracked files
Right now git status shows these untracked files (they won’t be public unless
you add/commit them):
•  02062026.md, 02072026.md, 02082026.md, 02092026.md

Strong recommendation (because history matters)
Making a repo public exposes full git history, not just the current files.
I didn’t find obvious secrets via pattern scans, but for higher confidence you
should run a dedicated secrets scanner on history, e.g. gitleaks or trufflehog.

```zsh
brew install gitleaks
gitleaks detect -v --redact --source .
```

If you want, I can help you make a “public-safe” version
Two common approaches:
1) Curate/export: create a new repo with only selected folders/files (no private
journals, no screenshots)
2) Sanitize in-place: remove/redact absolute paths, drop/strip media metadata,
add proper ignores, etc.
