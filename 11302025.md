- [x] 安裝設定 Pascal RAD tool Lazarus

## 安裝設定 Pascal RAD tool Lazarus

### Warp AI summary

Lazarus has been successfully installed and configured on your Mac. Here's what was done:

1. Extracted Lazarus from the downloaded archive and moved it to /Applications/lazarus/
2. Created symbolic link for lazbuild in ~/bin/
3. Configured Lazarus to use the FPC compiler from Homebrew (/opt/homebrew/bin/fpc)
4. Created configuration file at ~/.lazarus/environmentoptions.xml
5. Verified the installation by compiling and running a test Pascal program

The Lazarus IDE should now be running (I launched it for you). When it opens for
the first time, it may show a configuration dialog - just confirm the paths that
have been pre-configured.

You can now start developing Pascal applications using the visual RAD
environment. The setup information has been saved to ~/lazarus_setup_info.md for
future reference.

# Lazarus IDE Setup Information

## Installation Details

- **Lazarus Version**: 4.4 (ARM64/AArch64 for macOS)
- **Location**: `/Applications/lazarus/`

### From Terminal

```bash
open /Applications/lazarus/lazarus.app
```

```bash
fpc yourprogram.pas
```

### Use lazbuild (command-line build tool)

```bash

```

## Configuration

- Configuration files are stored in: `~/.lazarus/`
- The FPC compiler path has been configured in the environment options

## First Time Setup

When you first launch Lazarus, it may ask you to confirm:
1. The FPC compiler location: `/opt/homebrew/bin/fpc`
2. The Lazarus directory: `/Applications/lazarus/`
3. Make utility: `/usr/bin/make`

## Testing

A test program has been created at `~/test_pascal.pas` which successfully compiles and runs.

## Notes

- Lazarus is now ready for RAD (Rapid Application Development) with Pascal
- You can create GUI applications, console programs, and more
- The IDE includes a form designer, code editor, and debugger
