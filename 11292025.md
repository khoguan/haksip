- [ ] set up Neovim for Pascal programming

## keymap for diagnostics messages

我个學習生活停睏欲三個月，儂真餒志，今閣翻頭來學習電腦技術，一寡頂幫所學著个
nvim 个重要操作攏袂記得矣。開 US$ 20 買 Warp AI 來助贈回憶：

In your Neovim (AstroNvim configuration), the command mode hotkey to show
LSP/linter diagnostic descriptions is:

gl - This shows hover diagnostics for the current line

Additionally, <Leader>lD (typically <Space>lD) opens a search interface for all
diagnostics in the buffer.

If you want to see diagnostic details in different ways, you can also use:
• `[d` and `]d` to navigate between diagnostics
• Your custom command :DiagnosticInfo to print all diagnostics with their sources

## set up Neovim for Pascal programming

目前並無 nvim thang好使用个 Pascal LSP

With Claude 4.1 opus AI:

1. Tree-sitter Support: Installed Pascal parser for syntax highlighting
2. File Type Detection: Configured for .pas, .pp, .inc, .lpr, and .dpr files
3. Indentation Settings: 2 spaces, expandtab enabled
4. Custom Keymaps (using local leader ,):
◦  ,cc - Compile current file with fpc
◦  ,cr - Run compiled executable
◦  ,be (insert mode) - Insert begin...end block

Your Free Pascal Compiler is working correctly, and the compiled programs run
successfully. When you open Pascal files in Neovim, you'll get proper syntax
highlighting and indentation.
